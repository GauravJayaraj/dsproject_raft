## What is Raft consensus algorithm?
In a distributed system, data replication is needed for either fault-tolerance or latency optimization. Maintaining a consensus among all replications is crucial for the correctness and robustness of the distributed system. Various algorithms emerge to address this problem. Raft is an alternative designed to Paxos, aiming to be more understandable and to offer the same level of safety and robustness.
